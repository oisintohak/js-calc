CALCULATOR OPERATION FLOW

MINIMUM STATE VALUES:
VALUE
OPERATOR
NEW VALUE
RESULT


USER ENTERS VALUE X (VAL1)        --->>
(IF NO VALUE, ASIGN TO VAL1)
(IF VAL1, ASIGN TO VAL2)

USER ENTERS OPERATOR A  (OP1)      --->>  VALUE Z (RESULT)
(IF ITS EQUALS & ONLY 1 VALUE, THEN RETURN VALUE)
(IF THERE'S A PREVIOUS OPERATOR & ONLY 1 VALUE THEN ASIGN TO OP1)
(IF THERE'S A PRVIOUS OPERATOR AND 2 VALUES, CALCULATE PREVIOUS RESULT AND STORE NEW OPERATOR)


USER ENTERS VALUE Y  (VAL2)       ===>>

USER ENTERS OPERATOR  B (OP1)= THIS CAUSES OPERATOR A TO MANIPULATE VALUES X AND Y, RETURNING VALUE Z

USER ENTERS VALUE W

USER ENTERS OPERATOR C = THIS CAUSES OPERATOR B TO MANIPULATE VALUES Z AND W, RETURNING VALUE V




OPERATOR LOGIC:

IF THERE IS NO STORED OPERATOR THEN DO NO CALCULATION

IF THERE IS NO RESULT VALUE THEN USE VAL1 & VAL2
